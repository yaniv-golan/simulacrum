# Architecture and policy owners

## Overview

<!-- doc-review {"version":1,"fingerprint":"9e01d89dbbd1f466567dc547e386741b94016d4e93fd37d8ac5ec7d6000d2878","dependencies":"docs/development/.reviews/architecture/overview.json","dependencyDigest":"19b32488fb7586f27a5692c9fde85ae5290ebd835a0bb9331a782fce68da3b3d","disposition":"still accurate","rationale":"The manifest remains the single check metadata owner, now validating mergeSmoke coverage. AGENTS changes verification tiers only; runtime contracts and architectural layer authority remain unchanged."} -->

The [runtime contract](../contracts/runtime-v1.md) owns clocks, cursors, replay and
state ownership. [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) defines allowed layer edges. The
[registry reader](../../scripts/validate-manifest.mjs#source) loads the canonical `scripts/manifest.json` for milestone allocation and check metadata. This overview identifies that owner; use `npm run gate` and `npm run rules` for its current entries.

## Trace an edit

1. [Workshop application](../../src/application/workshop-app.mjs#source) composes the DOM view, clock and core.
2. [Workshop view](../../src/presentation/workshop-view.mjs#source) turns player input into ordinary commands. [Surface controls](../../src/presentation/surface-controls.mjs#source), their [placement lifecycle](../../src/presentation/placement-lifecycle.mjs#source), and [mirror controls](../../src/presentation/assembly-mirror.mjs#source) keep previews outside authored state. [Spring controls](../../src/presentation/spring-controls.mjs) submit bounded parameter edits and explain rejected drafts. Assembly capture and placement forms also remain transient; their accepted edits use the same core.
3. [createWorkshop](../../src/core/workshop.mjs#symbol=createWorkshop) admits commands, prepares a candidate and commits accepted edits as one history operation. Rejected/no-op edits preserve their specified cursor/history effects; Undo/Redo restores authored candidates.
4. [validateBlueprint](../../src/model/blueprint.mjs#symbol=validateBlueprint), [placement admission](../../src/model/surfaces.mjs) and [compileAssembly](../../src/model/assembly.mjs#symbol=compileAssembly) validate stored values, physical intersections and connection geometry before simulation receives configuration.
5. [Session](../../src/simulation/session.mjs) owns stepping, checkpoint and completed publication. [Controllers](../../src/simulation/controllers.mjs) produce program commands; the [receiver arbiter](../../src/simulation/receiver-arbiter.mjs) owns Manual/Automatic/Learned/Off, explicit takeover and prior-tick travel regulation; [power](../../src/simulation/power.mjs) resolves circuits; the [physics door](../../src/simulation/physics/world.mjs) alone imports the physics library. Completed contact collection uses the numeric [contact reader](../../src/simulation/physics/read-contacts.mjs); session assigns the completed interval and includes collection in integration timing.
6. [Observation store](../../src/model/observation.mjs) publishes immutable completed snapshots. Presentation consumes these observations, never a live physics object. The application drains a separate observation cursor into selected-body Measurements so its 120 Hz samples do not depend on rendering cadence.

The [assembly library](../../src/application/assembly-library.mjs#implementation) owns
browser persistence and validates definitions with the model. The
[assembly panel](../../src/presentation/assembly-library.mjs#source) displays
named and ordinary endpoints, receiver keys and independent instances. Named mounts
open the surface preview; interface edits use core admission. Placed instances and
saved snapshots have separate views, and saved authored settings are inspectable. Machine saves
embed all internals; simulation has no library dependency.

[Contact properties](../../src/model/contact-properties.mjs#symbol=contactProperties)
resolve material defaults and explicit friction/restitution overrides before the
physics door. Density remains material-owned. The inspector uses the same resolver.
[Retry](../../src/application/retry.mjs#symbol=createRetry) composes ordinary Build
and Run admission, releasing held controls and preserving the authored machine and
view. Completed contacts feed [impact presentation](../../src/presentation/impact-sound.mjs#source);
it has no simulation write path and resets its baseline on missing observations.

The application/view links cover their own composition and input routing code. The core, model and simulation links separately bind the admitted behavior; remote payload contents are outside these claims.

Build edits may replace the admitted configuration; Run uses the fixed simulation
path and forbids authoring edits. Returning to Build restores the editable starting
machine. The view preserves the camera when that starting machine remains visible;
otherwise it reframes without resetting viewing direction. A preview is a proposed edit, not a body pose write. Disposal must end owned
input operations and release handlers/resources. [Direct drag](../../src/presentation/direct-drag.mjs#source),
[editing controls](../../src/presentation/editing-controls.mjs#source), and
[vehicle controls](../../src/presentation/vehicle-controls.mjs#source) own their respective
input lifetimes; input cancellation runs on blur, lost capture and pause where applicable.

Part explanations, tooltip timers and the movable reference window live in
[part help](../../src/presentation/part-help.mjs). Window position, size and active tab
are presentation state. Closing retains the current type, tab and scroll for reopening;
choosing a different type resets the reading page. Catalog thumbnails are cached
independently of palette eligibility, so supported loaded-only parts have images too.
[Example diagrams](../../src/presentation/part-help-diagram.mjs)
render one node per example part and resize their connection paths with the window.
They never enter authored state or
history. The shared [help input scope](../../src/presentation/part-help-input.mjs)
precedes receiver capture and workshop shortcuts; entering it releases held receiver
input through the ordinary vehicle-controls command path. Returning to the workbench
requires a fresh key press. An open reference alone does not suppress controls.
Because the fixed heading is outside the scrolling content, part help forwards
reading keys from the header into the active page. Content focus keeps native
scrolling, while buttons and tab navigation retain their activation behavior.

Use `node scripts/navigate.mjs <owner-symbol>` to discover current consumers and tests.
These links explain policy responsibilities, not a second inventory of module edges.
Render-only decoration may illustrate a hub; it must not imply an authorable hole or
replace the collision geometry. Preserve independent physical test calculations when
sharing production policy: an oracle that calls the implementation proves little.

A cell can supply multiple motors; multiple cells on one circuit remain unsupported.
Shared motor torque, powered sensor loads and lamp delivery accounting belong to simulation.
The [lamp ratings](../../src/model/lamps.mjs#source) bound eight authored lamps at 10 W each.
[Power](../../src/simulation/power.mjs#symbol=createPowerNetwork) uses a source-rating-adaptive
resistive driver: conductance is requested watts divided by max(24 V, source nominal
voltage) squared. Droop and shared current limiting reduce delivery. Completed flux is
100 modeled lm per delivered watt; the cumulative circuit ledger counts lamp delivery
once alongside cell heat and other loads. Receiver wiring replaces the default command
of one; disabled, zero and negative commands request zero. Initial lamps are unstepped
and dark; restored completed records reconcile sources, tick and circuit accounting.
Instantaneous lamp readings also obey the common bus voltage, driver-current ceiling
and source droop/current bounds. Source draw includes motor PWM current from the completed control state. Passive
lamp/sensor-only circuits also match the limited resistive solution reconstructed
from completed draw and remaining charge; an unbounded driver cannot report false darkness.
Ground contact and workshop motion are not Course qualification.


## Shared sensing and behavior authoring

Sensor sample timing, channel semantics and receiver/controller ownership are unchanged."} -->

[Channel descriptors](../../src/model/sensors.mjs) own measurement units and frames.
[Sampling](../../src/simulation/sensors.mjs) reads completed physics through the door;
[power](../../src/simulation/power.mjs) funds each sensor. The selected
[sensor inspector](../../src/presentation/sensor-controls.mjs) and
[measurement overlay](../../src/presentation/sensor-view.mjs) consume completed data.

[Rules and draft admission](../../src/model/controller-authoring.mjs) own source
identity. The [bounded compiler](../../src/scripting/controller-program.mjs) admits
TypeScript and emits WASM; [executor construction](../../src/scripting/controller-executors.mjs)
is injected by core. Simulation has no scripting import edge. The controller editor
owns drafts and preservation, including exportable oversized text that cannot be applied;
accepted programs use ordinary atomic Build history. Numeric truth tests retain
TypeScript zero/NaN semantics.
[Decision projection](../../src/model/controller-decision.mjs) reads completed inputs
and applied ownership without evaluating a policy. Application-owned
[recent history](../../src/application/controller-history.mjs) drains the completed
cursor independently of training. Its [requested inspector](../../src/presentation/controller-history.mjs)
retains historical source/reading distinctions and returns repairs to Build.

[Learning model admission/training](../../src/model/learning-model.mjs) owns versioned
feature transforms and frozen numeric weights. The [workspace](../../src/application/learning-workspace.mjs)
owns teaching history, training candidates and user-requested installation. Capture
starts with the first valid observation and retains fault-only attempts outside training. Independent
[experiment evaluation](../../src/model/learning-evaluators.mjs) receives explicit role
