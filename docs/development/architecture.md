# Architecture and policy owners

## Overview
<!-- doc-review {"version":1,"fingerprint":"02b0b71c8c4bafd9857764c316eba2e4a8175af22024ad5ec333bb37ada20f1c","dependencies":"docs/development/.reviews/architecture/overview.json","dependencyDigest":"59e59174c0520d2ab54b5b6ba8f1e3288946923723e4e47912e50fb17fe464dc","disposition":"updated","rationale":"The authority introduction now has its own overview heading for navigation consumers; runtime, layer and manifest ownership claims and their existing dependencies are preserved."} -->

The [runtime contract](../contracts/runtime-v1.md) owns clocks, cursors, replay and
state ownership. [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) defines allowed layer edges. The
[manifest](../../scripts/manifest.json) owns milestone allocation and check metadata.

## Trace an edit

<!-- doc-review {"version":1,"fingerprint":"9fac3a5abb837635a2bcaedac71580968059f5737b530722923333729a2926c2","dependencies":"docs/development/.reviews/architecture/trace-an-edit.json","dependencyDigest":"2121ba3640f628c1c1100fd065675c14f485a78310dae0b34e0a1ff5186066e4","disposition":"updated","rationale":"Described named mount delegation to the existing surface preview, core-admitted interface edits and separate placed/saved views with inspectable authored settings."} -->

1. [Workshop application](../../src/application/workshop-app.mjs#implementation) composes the DOM view, clock and core.
2. [Workshop view](../../src/presentation/workshop-view.mjs) turns player input into ordinary commands. Surface and mirror controls keep previews outside authored state. Assembly capture and placement forms also remain transient; their accepted edits use the same core.
3. [createWorkshop](../../src/core/workshop.mjs#symbol=createWorkshop) admits commands, prepares a candidate and commits accepted edits as one history operation. Rejected/no-op edits preserve their specified cursor/history effects; Undo/Redo restores authored candidates.
4. [validateBlueprint](../../src/model/blueprint.mjs#symbol=validateBlueprint), [placement admission](../../src/model/surfaces.mjs) and [compileAssembly](../../src/model/assembly.mjs#symbol=compileAssembly) validate stored values, physical intersections and connection geometry before simulation receives configuration.
5. [Session](../../src/simulation/session.mjs) owns stepping, checkpoint and completed publication. [Controllers](../../src/simulation/controllers.mjs) produce commands; [power](../../src/simulation/power.mjs) resolves circuits; the [physics door](../../src/simulation/physics/world.mjs) alone imports the physics library.
6. [Observation store](../../src/model/observation.mjs) publishes immutable completed snapshots. Presentation consumes these observations, never a live physics object.

The [assembly library](../../src/application/assembly-library.mjs#implementation) owns
browser persistence and validates definitions with the model. The
[assembly panel](../../src/presentation/assembly-library.mjs#implementation) displays
named and ordinary endpoints, receiver keys and independent instances. Named mounts
open the surface preview; interface edits use core admission. Placed instances and
saved snapshots have separate views, and saved authored settings are inspectable. Machine saves
embed all internals; simulation has no library dependency.

The application link covers composition code and declared dependencies, not remote runtime payload contents.

Build edits may replace the admitted configuration; Run uses the fixed simulation
path and forbids authoring edits. Returning to Build restores the editable starting
machine. A preview is a proposed edit, not a body pose write. Disposal must end owned
input operations and release handlers/resources; input cancellation also runs on blur,
lost capture and pause where applicable.

Use `node scripts/navigate.mjs <owner-symbol>` to discover current consumers and tests.
These links explain policy responsibilities, not a second inventory of module edges.
Render-only decoration may illustrate a hub; it must not imply an authorable hole or
replace the collision geometry. Preserve independent physical test calculations when
sharing production policy: an oracle that calls the implementation proves little.

A cell can supply multiple motors; multiple cells on one circuit remain unsupported.
Shared motor torque accounting and the completed energy ledger belong to simulation.
Ground contact and workshop motion are not Course qualification.
