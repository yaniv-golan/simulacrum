# Change recipes

Use the [map](architecture.md) to locate the owner, inspect its reverse consumers with
`node scripts/navigate.mjs <symbol-or-path>`, then use focused tests. Admit changes
through the public command surface. A view-local convenience must not become a second
attachment, polarity, naming, reset or authored-property policy.

## Add or extend a part

Start with [CATALOG](../../src/model/catalog.mjs), [schema](../../src/model/blueprint.schema.json)
and [createPart](../../src/model/blueprint.mjs). Declare its current milestone in
[features](../../src/model/features.mjs). Use [partPrimitives](../../src/model/geometry.mjs)
for authored shapes and [surfaceRegions](../../src/model/surfaces.mjs) for mounting.
The [compiler](../../src/model/assembly.mjs) derives configuration; the renderer consumes
the same geometry. Do not select material or forces by name, role or fixture identity.

Worked example: wheel diameter changes radius while keeping axle position and width.
Trace `partPrimitives`, then read [wheel diameter tests](../../test/wheel-diameter.test.mjs)
and [assembly tests](../../test/assembly.test.mjs). Check schema rejection, material/mass,
endpoints, resize overlap, Undo and save/load, then rendered geometry. Rebuild generated
validation with `node scripts/generate-schema.mjs` when schema changes.

## Add a command

Start at [createWorkshop](../../src/core/workshop.mjs). Validate shape before reading
untrusted fields, copy accepted inputs, derive a candidate through model operations,
and publish only after successful compilation. One accepted edit owns one history
transaction; stale/no-op/rejected effects must be explicit.

Worked example: `surface-mount` delegates to [proposeSurfaceMount](../../src/model/assembly.mjs).
[Surface mount tests](../../test/surface-mount.test.mjs) exercise stale cursor rejection,
mounting, adjustment and Undo. Add malformed input, accepted effect, rejected-state
identity, Undo/Redo and save/load cases through `core.act`. Reuse the [editing contract assertions](../../test/contracts/editing.mjs) as shown by [mixed editing examples](../../test/editing-contracts.test.mjs); inspect
`node scripts/explain-invariant.mjs rejected-edit-atomicity`.

## Change an interaction

Start with [surface controls](../../src/presentation/surface-controls.mjs) or
[editing controls](../../src/presentation/editing-controls.mjs), composed by the view.
Keep preview and pointer ownership in presentation; commit through the existing core
command. Cancellation must terminate the owned operation without committing it.

Worked example: [mirror controls](../../src/presentation/assembly-mirror.mjs) call the
same model proposal used by the core. Test preview isolation, blocked release, Escape,
blur/lost capture and stale completion. Run [mirror model tests](../../test/mirror-assembly.test.mjs)
and the registered [mirror browser verifier](../../scripts/verify-mirror-browser.mjs).
Receiver overrides must use [vehicle controls](../../src/presentation/vehicle-controls.mjs),
not dispatch a second reset or directly write actuator state.

## Add a diagnostic

Start at [diagnoseMotion](../../src/model/motion-diagnostics.mjs). Consume completed
observation values only. Return an explanation and relevant part IDs; presentation
owns navigation and wording layout. Do not repair authored state or infer intention
from a machine name.

Worked example: opposing-drive diagnostics identify command-adjusted axes on a shared
assembly and suggest checking direction. Read [opposed-drive tests](../../test/opposed-drive-diagnostic.test.mjs)
and [motion diagnostics tests](../../test/motion-diagnostics.test.mjs). Include a real
symptom, a similar valid configuration that must remain quiet, and missing-data cases.
A symptom is not proof of the intended mechanism or cause.

## Change physics

Start at the [narrow door](../../src/simulation/physics/world.mjs), with numerical laws
under [motor law](../../src/simulation/physics/law/motor.mjs) or
[constraint law](../../src/simulation/physics/law/constraints.mjs). Configuration comes
from the compiler; laws receive numerical inputs, not identities. The session owns
phase ordering and one integration; do not introduce a second clock or hidden support.

Worked example: a motor-work change needs independent energy accounting in
[impulse energy tests](../../test/impulse-energy.test.mjs), shared-body controls in
[shared power tests](../../test/shared-power.test.mjs), checkpoint-next-step tests in
[session tests](../../test/session.test.mjs), and deterministic multi-process checks.
Use analytical expectations and passive mirrored controls before tuning a controller.
Run the actual gate; a workshop smoke pass does not qualify a Course bar.
